All the code are tested in remote machine.

For part1 : 
    1. I have finished the basic task.
    2. For the challenge part, I have finished the basic manipulator,
       but I have not done the "ffr(std::endl) and ffr(std::ends)"
       So I comment the test file from line 125 to line 136
For part2:
    1. I have done the challenge part for lastdimensioniterator and it works
    fine.


For part3:
    1. I have done this challenge part, but the result seems different from
      the solution provied by professor.
    2. My test files has been modified based on the provoided test file by 
      adding two catches of LockedByOtherThread at line 106 and 126
